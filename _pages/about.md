Welcome! 

I'm **Sungbin Park** who received my B.S. of Computer Science at Hanyang University, Ansan, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in [AI and Cybersecurity Laboratory]{https://ace.hanyang.ac.kr} (advisor: [Yeonjoon Lee]{https://yeonjoonlee.com}) at same university.

As a cybersecurity researcher, I am interested in privacy, usable security, and cybercrime.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly badminton, tennis, and cycling), and playing instruments, such as guitar and piano.
